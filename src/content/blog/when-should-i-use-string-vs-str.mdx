Rust has two main string types: `String` and `&str`. Sometimes, people argue
that these two types make Rust code difficult to write, because you have to
think about which one you should be using in a given situation. My experience
of writing Rust is that I don't really think about this very much, and this
post is about some rules of thumb that you can use to be like me.

## Level 1: Don't think about it at all

The very first thing you can do is follow the simplest rule:

> Always use `String`, never use `&str`.

That looks like this:

```rust
struct Person {
    name: String,
}

fn first_word(words: String) -> String {
    words
        .split_whitespace()
        .next()
        .expect("words should not be empty")
        .to_string()
}
```

This style means you may need to add `.to_string()` or `.clone()`
for things to work sometimes:

```rust
fn main() {
    let sentence = "Hello, world!";

    println!("{}", first_word(sentence.to_string()));

    let owned = String::from("A string");

    // if we don't clone here, we can't use owned the second time
    println!("{}", first_word(owned.clone()));
    println!("{}", first_word(owned));
}
```

But that's okay, the compiler will let you know when you need to:

```text
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `owned`
  --> src/main.rs:21:31
   |
18 |     let owned = String::from("A string");
   |         ----- move occurs because `owned` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
19 |
20 |     println!("{}", first_word(owned));
   |                               ----- value moved here
21 |     println!("{}", first_word(owned));
   |                               ^^^^^ value used here after move
   |
note: consider changing this parameter type in function `first_word` to borrow instead if owning the value isn't necessary
  --> src/main.rs:5:22
   |
5  | fn first_word(words: String) -> String {
   |    ----------        ^^^^^^ this parameter takes ownership of the value
   |    |
   |    in this function
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
   |
20 |     println!("{}", first_word(owned.clone()));
   |                                    ++++++++
```

Hey, compiler, that's a great idea. Let's move on to level 2.

## Level 2: prefer `&str` for function parameters

A rule that's a little better is this one:

> Always use `String` in structs, and for functions, use `&str` for parameters
> and `String` types for return values.

This is what the compiler error for level 1 was suggesting we do instead of `.clone`.

That results in code that looks like this:

```rust
struct Person {
    name: String,
}

fn first_word(words: &str) -> String {
    words
        .split_whitespace()
        .next()
        .expect("words should not be empty")
        .to_string()
}

fn main() {
    let sentence = "Hello, world!";

    println!("{}", first_word(sentence));

    let owned = String::from("A string");

    println!("{}", first_word(&owned));
    println!("{}", first_word(&owned));
}
```

We're now doing much less copying. We do need to add a `&` on
to `String` values that we wish to pass into `first_word`, but
that's not too bad, the compiler will help us when we forget:

```text
error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --> src/main.rs:20:31
   |
20 |     println!("{}", first_word(owned));
   |                    ---------- ^^^^^ expected `&str`, found `String`
   |                    |
   |                    arguments to this function are incorrect
   |
note: function defined here
  --> src/main.rs:5:4
   |
5  | fn first_word(words: &str) -> String {
   |    ^^^^^^^^^^ -----------
help: consider borrowing here
   |
20 |     println!("{}", first_word(&owned));
   |                               +
```

Following this rule will get you through 95% of situations successfully. Yes,
that number was found via the very scientific process of "I made it up, but it
feels correct after writing Rust for the last twelve years."

For 4% of that last 5%, we can go to level 3:

## Level 3: return `&str` sometimes

Here's a slightly more advanced rule for certain circumstances:

> Always use `String` in structs, and for functions, use `&str` for parameters.
> If the return type of your function is derived from an argument and isnâ€™t
> mutated by the body, return `&str`. If you run into any trouble here, return
> `String` instead.

That would look like this:

```rust
struct Person {
    name: String,
}

// we're returning a substring of words, so &str is appropriate
fn first_word(words: &str) -> &str {
    words
        .split_whitespace()
        .next()
        .expect("words should not be empty")
}

fn main() {
    let sentence = "Hello, world!";

    println!("{}", first_word(sentence));

    let owned = String::from("A string");

    println!("{}", first_word(&owned));
    println!("{}", first_word(&owned));
}
```

This lets us remove a copy, we no longer have a `.to_string` in the body of
`first_word`.

Sometimes, we can't do that though:

```rust
// because we are going to uppercase the first word, our return type can't
// be &str anymore, because we aren't actually returning a substring: we are
// creating our own new string.
fn first_word_uppercase(words: &str) -> String {
    words
        .split_whitespace()
        .next()
        .expect("words should not be empty")
        .to_uppercase()
}

fn main() {
    let sentence = "Hello, world!";

    println!("{}", first_word_uppercase(sentence));

    let owned = String::from("A string");

    println!("{}", first_word_uppercase(&owned));
    println!("{}", first_word_uppercase(&owned));
}
```

How do you know that this is the case? Well, in this specific case,
`to_uppercase` already returns a `String`. So that's a great hint.
If we tried to return a `&str`, we'd get an error:

```rust
// this can't work
fn first_word_uppercase(words: &str) -> &str {
    &words
        .split_whitespace()
        .next()
        .expect("words should not be empty")
        .to_uppercase()
}
```

would give us

```text
error[E0515]: cannot return reference to temporary value
  --> src/main.rs:7:5
   |
7  |        &words
   |  ______^-
   | | ______|
8  | ||         .split_whitespace()
9  | ||         .next()
10 | ||         .expect("words should not be empty")
11 | ||         .to_uppercase()
   | ||                       ^
   | ||_______________________|
   |  |_______________________returns a reference to data owned by the current function
   |                          temporary value created here
```

And that's really it. Following this rule will get you through virtually every
scenario where you need to wonder about `String` and `&str`. With some practice,
you'll internalize these rules, and when you feel comfortable with a level, you
can go up to the next one.

What about that last 1% though? Well, there is a next level...

## Level 4: When to use `&str` in a struct

Here's the rule for level 4:

> Should you use a `&str` in a struct? If you're asking that question, use
> `String`. When you need to use `&str` in a struct, you'll know.

Storing references in structs is useful, for sure, and it's good that Rust
supports it. But you're only going to need it in fairly specific scenarios,
and if you feel like you're worring about `String` vs `&str`, you're just
not in the position to be worrying about the complexity of storing a `&str`
in a struct yet.

In fact, some people believe in this rule so strongly that they're working
on a language where storing references in structs isn't even possible, and
it's a language I've found very interesting lately:
[Hylo](https://www.hylo-lang.org/). They go a bit farther than that, even:
in Hylo, you think of everything as being values, rather than having references
at all. They think that you can write meaningful programs with this model.
But this isn't a post about Hylo. I'll write one of those eventually. My point
is just that you can really, truly, get away with not storing `&str`s in structs
for a _lot_ of useful Rust programs. So it's not really worth spending mental
energy on, until you determine that you must do so. That is the case when
you've profiled your program and determined that copying strings to and from
your struct is a big enough issue to bother with lifetimes.

I hope you've found this helpful, and if you have any other rules of thumb
like this, I'd love to hear about them!
