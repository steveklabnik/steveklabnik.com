This is something I’ve been joking about for a while, but I’ve decided for the near future, I’m just going to be posting things to Twitter, and not reading replies or anything.

So, if you don’t get a fav or a reply or something, it’s nothing personal.

There’s a lot going into this decision, but basically, I haven’t been actually doing a lot of things that I want to do because I’m super stressed out. Turns out Twitter is also a huge cause of stress in my life. Turns out Twitter is also a large part of my social interaction, so I’ve kept doing it even though I know it’s not great for me.

So, we’ll see what a post-read/write Twitter is like. You know how to get a hold of me otherwise.
