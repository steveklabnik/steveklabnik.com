Every once in a while, I unfollow EVERYONE on Twitter. I did it again last night. Feels good, like a fresh start.

Part of the problem is that I feel like I should be following everyone who I know in real life. This causes Twitter to be absolutely unmanageable, as I’m following far too many. So then I just dip into the stream every so often, but then I miss some people’s tweets entirely. So why follow them all in the first place?

So, if I’ve unfollowed you, don’t worry, I still <3 you. And even as I start following people back, I’m doing it slowly, and at semi-random. Trying to get some people I hadn’t seen in a while. People from outside my own community. People that’ll make me a little less caremad.

Yeah, like that’ll last.
