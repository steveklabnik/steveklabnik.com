As someone who has [significantly different beliefs than Peter Thiel](https://www.inc.com/jeff-bercovici/peter-thiel-young-blood.html), today is likely my second-to-last power of two years alive.

Two years ago, [I wrote a post about turning 30](http://words.steveklabnik.com/a-eulogy-for-my-20s), and I pretty much feel the same way. Never enough time, tick tock, tick tock. I have today off (thanks Mozilla!), but am still considering working anyway, because I really care about what I’m working on, and am excited about it. We’ll see.

I feel like I have more to say here, but also don’t. So maybe let’s leave it at that.
