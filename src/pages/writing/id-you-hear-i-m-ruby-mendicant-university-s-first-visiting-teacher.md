I’ve heard [Ruby Mendicant University](http://university.rubymendicant.com/) (also known as RMU, not to confuse you Robert Morris alums!) described as “the best kept secret of the Ruby community.” High praise, indeed. If you haven’t heard about RMU before, check out this presentation by Andrew Cox:

TL;DR: RMU is a free, online ‘unversity’ from Gregory Brown, author of ‘Ruby Best Practices.’ You enter an intermediate Rubyist, and you exit an expert.

Anyway, RMU recently announced that [I’ll be their first visiting teacher](http://university.rubymendicant.com/changelog/visiting-teacher-2011-t2-steve-klabnik). Basically, I’ll be hanging out, giving advice, and just generally being even more accessible to RMU students than I already am. Greg and I have talked a lot about education, Ruby, and a lot of other things… between Hackety’s ‘nothing to intermediate’ and RMU’s ‘intermediate to expert’ approaches to learning, anyone wanting to get up to speed with Ruby should have no shortage of resources at their disposal.

If you’re feeling like you’ve got the hang of Ruby, but want to take it to the next level, [applications are open](http://university.rubymendicant.com/admissions)! Hopefully I’ll see you there.
